# WaqBay-Interactive-Activity
An interactive program made for educational purposes for, and solely for the [Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve](http://waquoitbayreserve.org/).

This program provides a general overview of a few notable organisms across Waquoit Bay, with images and interesting information to highlight the unique properties of each organism. There is also an interactive timeline highlighting the impact of eutrophication in the bay over time due to sewage discharge.

This repo contains only the final [asset files](/Assets) and [build files](/Builds) for this unity project.

Created using [Unity](https://unity.com/).
